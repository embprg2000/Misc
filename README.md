This directory contain some example programs and scripts.

*** Octave

Octave is a great program when you don't have access to matlab. When
I can choose between matlab and octave I would take matlab anytime.
However matlab is very expensive and octave is free. The licencing of
 matlab has given me a lot of troubles too. Being anywhere on the road
 I can just download octave anytime.

*** wxMaxima
wxMaxima is a document based interface for the computer algebra system
Maxima. Maxima is a system for the manipulation of symbolic and numerical
expressions, including differentiation, integration, Taylor series,
Laplace transforms, ordinary differential equations, systems of linear equations,
polynomials, sets, lists, vectors, matrices and tensors. Maxima yields high
precision numerical results by using exact fractions, arbitrary-precision 
integers and variable-precision floating-point numbers. Maxima can plot 
functions and data in two and three dimensions. 

A great free program which has several nice features that the
symbolic package from octave does not have.
